              Welcome to the flavorful world of Restaurantly! Our story begins
              in the vibrant culinary landscape of New York City in the late
              1980s. It was during this time that our founders, Mei Chen and
              James Thompson, crossed paths while pursuing their culinary
              passions at the renowned Culinary Institute of America.

              After years of exploring diverse cuisines and honing their
              culinary skills, Mei and James envisioned a restaurant that would
              blend the bold flavors of Asia with the refined techniques of the
              West. In 1995, their dream became a reality with the opening of
              Restaurantly.

              The early days at Restaurantly were dedicated to crafting an
              innovative menu that would showcase the best of both worlds. Mei
              and James meticulously developed signature dishes like our
              "Szechuan Duck Confit with Truffle Risotto" and "Wasabi-Crusted
              Filet Mignon," setting the stage for a culinary journey unlike any
              other.
